            <p class="boxP">
              Nestled at the foot of Mount Snowdon, the highest mountain in
              Wales, this hostel has a rich history tied to mountaineering and
              the great outdoors. Originally built as a coach inn in the late
              1800s, it served travelers journeying through the rugged terrain
              of Snowdonia. What makes Pen-y-Pass special is its role in outdoor
              culture. Over the decades, it became a base for legendary climbers
              who tackled the Snowdon Horseshoe—a challenging circuit of
              ridges—and contributed to the development of modern mountaineering
              in the UK.

            Located in a beautifully preserved Victorian mansion built in 1885,
            the HI Sacramento Hostel offers a glimpse into the grandeur of
            California's past. Originally the home of a wealthy gold prospector,
            the mansion later became a boarding house and eventually a hostel.
            Its elegant architecture, complete with stained glass windows,
            carved wooden staircases, and period furnishings, makes it a unique
            blend of history and hospitality.

          <p class="textTwo">
            Once a courthouse in the heart of London, Clink78 Hostel is steeped
            in history. Built in the 19th century, the building was where
            Charles Dickens worked as a court reporter, inspiring elements of
            his famous novel Oliver Twist. In the 20th century, it served as a
            magistrates' court and famously hosted trials for punk bands like
            The Clash. Today, the hostel preserves its legal heritage—guests can
            stay in refurbished prison cells and relax in the
            courtroom-turned-lounge.
